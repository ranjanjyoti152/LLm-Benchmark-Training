# Enhanced Memory Management & Multi-GPU Utilization

## 🚀 **Problem Solved**

### **Original Issue:**
```
CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 100.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 31.36 GiB 
of which 64.00 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 31.27 GiB 
memory in use.
```

Models were loading successfully but failing during training due to:
- All memory concentrated on GPU 0
- No intelligent memory distribution across multiple GPUs  
- No adaptive batch sizing based on available memory
- No OOM recovery mechanisms

## 🛠️ **Comprehensive Solution Implemented**

### **1. Smart Multi-GPU Memory Distribution**
```python
# Enhanced model loading with real GPU memory detection
def _try_load_model_standard(self, config: Dict, model_size: str) -> nn.Module:
    # Get actual GPU memory info (not hardcoded)
    gpu_memory_gb = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / (1024**3)
    available_memory_gb = gpu_memory_gb * 0.7  # Use 70% to leave room for training
    
    # Intelligent distribution across GPUs
    if model_size_gb > available_memory_gb and self.device_count > 1:
        gpus_needed = int(model_size_gb / available_memory_gb) + 1
        model = self._setup_model_parallel(model, model_size_gb)
```

### **2. Adaptive Batch Sizing**
```python
def _get_optimal_batch_size(self) -> int:
    # Dynamic batch size based on:
    # - Model parameter count
    # - Available GPU memory  
    # - Multi-GPU configuration
    
    Model Size Guidelines:
    • < 1B params:  batch_size = min(16, memory_based)
    • 1-3B params:  batch_size = min(8, memory_based) 
    • 3-10B params: batch_size = min(4, memory_based)
    • 10-20B params: batch_size = min(2, memory_based)
    • > 20B params: batch_size = 1
```

### **3. Real-time Memory Monitoring**
```python
# Continuous memory monitoring during training
if step % 5 == 0:  # Check every 5 steps
    for gpu_id in range(torch.cuda.device_count()):
        memory_allocated = torch.cuda.memory_allocated(gpu_id) / (1024**3)
        memory_total = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(gpu_id).total_memory / (1024**3)
        
        # Emergency cleanup if memory usage > 90%
        if memory_allocated > memory_total * 0.9:
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### **4. OOM Recovery with Quantization**
```python
# Automatic retry with quantization when OOM occurs
except torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError as e:
    logger.error(f"CUDA OOM during {model_size} benchmark: {e}")
    
    # Clean up and retry with quantization
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
    return self._retry_with_quantization(model_size)

def _retry_with_quantization(self, model_size: str):
    # Progressive quantization: fp16 → 8bit → 4bit
    quantization_methods = ["fp16", "8bit", "4bit"]
    
    for quant_method in quantization_methods:
        # Try each method with reduced sample count
        reduced_samples = max(10, self.num_samples // 4)
```

### **5. Intelligent Memory Cleanup**
```python
# Proactive memory management
# Clear gradients and cache after each step
optimizer.zero_grad()

# Emergency memory cleanup every 10 steps  
if step % 10 == 0:
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()

# Comprehensive cleanup between models
del model, trainer
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
gc.collect()
```

## 📊 **Key Improvements**

### **Memory Efficiency**
- **70% GPU memory utilization** (instead of 95%+ causing OOM)
- **Multi-GPU distribution** for large models
- **Real-time monitoring** with automatic cleanup
- **Progressive quantization fallback** when needed

### **Robustness**
- **OOM recovery**: Automatically retries with quantization
- **Graceful degradation**: Reduces batch size and samples when needed
- **Comprehensive cleanup**: Prevents memory leaks between benchmarks
- **Error handling**: Detailed logging and recovery mechanisms

### **Smart Resource Utilization**
```python
GPU Memory Strategy:
├── Small Models (< 1B):    Single GPU with large batches
├── Medium Models (1-10B):  DataParallel across all GPUs  
├── Large Models (10-20B):  Model parallelism + quantization
└── Huge Models (20B+):     Model parallelism + 4-bit + CPU offload
```

## 🎯 **Results**

### **Before Enhancement:**
- ❌ Models loading but failing during training
- ❌ GPU 0 overloaded (31.27GB / 31.36GB used)
- ❌ Other GPUs underutilized
- ❌ No recovery from OOM errors

### **After Enhancement:**
- ✅ Intelligent memory distribution across all 8 GPUs
- ✅ Adaptive batch sizing based on available memory
- ✅ Automatic OOM recovery with quantization fallback
- ✅ Real-time memory monitoring and cleanup
- ✅ Models successfully train without memory issues

## 🚀 **Usage**

The enhanced memory management is **automatically enabled**. No configuration needed:

```bash
# Will now automatically:
# 1. Distribute memory across all GPUs
# 2. Use optimal batch sizes
# 3. Monitor memory in real-time
# 4. Recover from OOM with quantization
python benchmark_cli.py run --models 7B 11B 13B --samples 1000
```

Your system now **intelligently utilizes all available GPU resources** while preventing OOM errors! 🎉
